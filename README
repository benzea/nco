This NCO uses a CORDIC MyHDL core that is can be configured to the required
needs. A small GUI application is included which can be used to configure
the core and check the resulting performance characteristics.

The CORDIC and Rule30 PRNG cores can be used as standalone cores.


NCO
===

To configure the NCO and use it you need the following dependencies:
 * GTK+ 3.x
 * Matplotlib
 * MyHDL 0.8

Then run the script:
$ nco/parameterize_nco.py

If you copy the toVHDL_kh.py file from the "myhdl-addons" repository into
the nco directory, then multiple entities will be created.
